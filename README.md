Overview:

Pi eCard is the innovative solution to the issues presented during the world’s transition from fiat currency to crypto. Currently, the majority of highstreet retailers don’t accept any form of cryptocurrency as payment, despite them rapidly gaining traction. With over 300 million crypto currency users worldwide, with over 30 million on the Pi Network™, there is a great social change currently happening. This, however, will be a very timely transition, which requires a solid stepping stone to kickstart the change, in the form of a proof of concept intermediate solution.

 
Pi eCard aims to be this solution. Pioneers will be able to buy Pi credits through our app, which will be backed 1:1 with Pi in our treasury wallet. As a result, Pioneers will always be able to withdraw their Pi at any time. Using Visa APIs, Pioneers will be able to spend this Pi credit online or in the stores of any of the 44 million Visa-accepting businesses. The card will either be a physical card or digital wallet.
